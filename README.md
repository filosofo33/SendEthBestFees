# SendEthBestFees
This small Nodejs script allows you to send eth (ethereum) or a lot of erc20 tokens while calculating automatically the minimum gas fees needed so that your transaction enter in the next block. 

Also usefull for emptying your wallet sending erc20 spam tokens to burn address 0x0..0 or 0x0..01 and for trying to clean ethereum dust (leaving your wallet closest to 0 eth, emptying ether dust).
